# Odin
## Project goal
A generic physics debug tool to capture and visual physics data from a physics engine. It should provide the ability to capture and query the state of the physics engine at every frame of the simulation, in adition to profiling data.
## Folder structure
- **odin** is the main project folder, and contains all files and code ascociated with the final application. It contains the debug tool "Odin", a test bed client which will generate Odin data, along with design ideas and the protobuf projects.
- **prototype** is the complete files for the original prototype. It includes the original debug tool prototype, a test bed client which will send data to the debug tool as well as the protobuff schemas
