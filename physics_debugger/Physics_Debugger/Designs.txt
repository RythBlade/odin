---- Mesh Handling ----
- 

---- Message Types ----
- "thing"/mesh/rigid body created
- "thing"/mesh/rigid body data changed (mesh changed, or random setting altered on the object)

---- Network Flow ----
- Initial hand-shakes to establish connection
- Do we need an intial dump of data - or can it be iteratively sent across as it happens - e.g. as meshes are instanced, or settings change. Is there anything we need to know from the outset? I don't think there is
